This is my first project as a ML student.
The project is basically manages student marks.
In the project I have used python, numpy and jupyter notebooks for development.
Core working of the project:-
  The project first creates a dataset which includes marks of 100 students across 5 subjects.
  Then tags the dataset according to the subjects.
  After that it finds out the total marks of each student.
  Next the 5 top scorers are identified and a subject wise analysis is recorded.
  At the end it displays the overall insights of the project.
